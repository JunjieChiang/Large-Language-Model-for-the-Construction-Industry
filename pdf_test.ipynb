These\\ndevelopments are becoming increasingly relevant also for creative\\ndomains as they potentially enable more collaborative and dynamic\\nco-creative work of humans and AI systems. Trained on a large data\\ncorpus, such generative system can now synthesize new original\\ncontent. However, user control over the generated output remains\\nchallenging. This requires effective interactions and user interfaces,\\nas well as underlying AI mechanisms to support conditional and\\ncontrolled generation.\\nOne emergent interaction technique, especially for text genera-\\ntion, is the use of natural language prompts to steer the generative\\nsystem: It was found that large language models (LLMs) do not\\nnecessarily need to be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as for sen-\\ntiment classification or topical text generation [ 6].

However, the design\\nof an effective prompting interface has not yet been explored sys-\\ntematically from a Human-Computer Interaction perspective. To\\naddress this, we collected and present key opportunities and chal-\\nlenges for prompting as a new paradigm for Human-AI interaction\\nand propose and illustrate four design goals for user interfaces that\\nsupport this. With this, we provide an overview and starting points\\nfor future research on user interfaces for models capable of zero-\\nand few-shot learning.\\n2 RELATED WORK\\nWe give an overview of work on interactive use of prompting, as\\nwell as techniques developed in prompt engineering.\\n2.1 Interactive Applications Using Few-shot\\nLearning\\nWriting effective prompts is often not straightforward for users.\\nA couple of recent projects have addressed this: For example, AI\\nChains is an interactive tool to combine a sequence of (sub-)tasks\\nto be solved with repeated runs of one LLM [ 21]. Related, Synth-\\nBiouses few-shot learning to synthesise a data corpus of biogra-\\nphies [ 22] . This text synthesis consists of multiple steps, involv-\\ning both an LLM to synthesize new biographies and humans to\\nrate them. Both these systems [ 21,22] focus on a combination of\\nprompts as a means to reduce task complexity. In this paper, we\\nhighlight the idea of supporting prompt composition and combi-\\nnation as a key design goal and direction for user interfaces for\\nprompting.\\nFurther interactive examples include Story Centaur by Pietrzak\\net al. [16] , an application for non-technical users to quickly con-\\nstruct prompts with few-shot examples: Through a graphical user\\ninterface users can define input and output text phrases, as well\\nas phrases to be included before, in-between, or after each such\\nexample. The tool formats these components as a text prompt for\\nfew-shot learning. Related, Austin et al . [2] also built a tool that\\nprovides a template for prompt input in its UI, here to support\\nsynthesis of computer programs. Supporting prompt formulation\\nand input is one of the key design goals for user interfaces that we\\ndiscuss in this paper.\\n2.2 Prompt Engineering\\nPrompt engineering refers to the systematic practice of constructing\\nprompts to improve the generated output of a generative model.\\nParticular examples include these insights: Lu et al . [14] have found\\nthat word order affects the generated outcome. Moreover, while\\nproviding longer context in prompts empirically resulted in better\\ntext outputs [ 3,8], Wu et al . [21] have found that task instructions\\nwithin a longer context body can also conflict with each other.\\nO’Connor and Andreas [15] provide a framework to determine\\n“how much” information of the original context the prompt can\\nactively use in the generation process. Another approach to elicit\\nbetter prompts is to use the LLM itself for problem elaborations [ 4],\\ninspired by the “think aloud” strategy humans use to solve complex\\nproblems.Other strategies improve text prompts algorithmically: For ex-\\nample, Liu et al. [12] use sentence embedding on prompts to auto-\\nmatically sample neighboring prompt alternatives for comparison.\\nAutoPrompt [20] optimises a set of words in the prompt using the\\ngradient with respect to a task output (e.g. sentiment classifica-\\ntion). Related, “prefix tuning” draws inspiration from prompting\\nbut optimises context tokens that do not need to map to actual\\nwords [11].\\nFinally, prompt-style input/output can also be used to finetune\\nlanguage models (“Pattern Exploiting Training” [ 19]) yet this is\\ndifferent from the prompts we discuss in this paper in that we\\naim to utilise their capability to perform (end user-specified) tasks\\nad-hoc without task-specific model training/finetuning.\\n3 METHOD\\nWe organised two one-hour long brainstorming sessions with five\\nHCI researchers to discuss and collect speculative opportunities and', metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ad-hoc without task-specific model training/finetuning.\\n3 METHOD\\nWe organised two one-hour long brainstorming sessions with five\\nHCI researchers to discuss and collect speculative opportunities and\\nchallenges that result from the prompt design paradigm to spark\\nnew discussions about the impact of prompt writing for creative\\nexpression. The first session included multiple phases. First, each\\nparticipant quietly noted potential opportunities and challenges on\\na virtual whiteboard. In the second step, each participant briefly\\nintroduced their idea and then similar ideas were clustered. Finally,\\nfollowing a discussion and using the previously formed clusters, we\\nidentified overarching topics that we introduce in sections 4 and 5.\\nIn the second session we started with a similar approach and\\ncollected ideas on the interactive use of prompt writing. In the\\nbrainstorming session we listed existing interactive systems that\\nsupport users to prompt large language models (refer to 2.1) and\\ndrew inspiration for designing new scenarios to help users in their\\ncreative writing process. We started with the question of what\\ncreative writing means, followed by each researcher noting down\\npotential goals and motivations for creative writing. Based on these\\nnotes we identified a three phase creative writing process which\\nthe ideal prompt writing support tool should cover at the very least\\n(6).\\n4 OPPORTUNITIES\\nWe highlight three opportunities that prompting may bring to the\\ntable. While our concrete examples focus on the use case of creative\\nwriting, the opportunities themselves are not limited to that domain.\\n4.1 End-User Programming of Creative Tools\\nFundamentally, prompting LLMs at runtime gives the user the\\nopportunity to define new tools ad hoc as needed , without retraining\\nthe model. This could be especially interesting for users without\\na technical background, because they can use natural language to\\ndefine the tools they need and when they need it.\\nBy defining generic prompts the users may also build up a library\\nof generative tools for reuse in different contexts . Defining such tools\\ncan be done through programming by example (few-shot learning)\\norby declaration (zero shot learning).\\nGenerating code from natural language prompts (e.g. OpenaAI’s\\nCodex [7]) empowers users to create, adapt and appropriate digital\\ntools (cf. [ 9]). However, prompting need not be limited to an inter-\\npretation as “code generation”; it could also be viewed as powering', metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

This elevates the AI to\\nbe an active and dynamic contributor for the joint generation of\\nnew media instead of being a predefined assistant or toolbox.\\n4.2 Extending and Augmenting Creative\\nExpressiveness\\nIt is often not straight forward to sufficiently describe certain con-\\ncepts in detail, especially in artistic contexts. For example, it would\\nbe very difficult to exactly describe certain text styles, but it is easy\\nto express vague concepts via a prompt to an LLM, such as to “write\\na text in the prose of Shakespeare”. Other creative use involves\\nprompting across modalities , such as text to image models [ 17], or\\nprompting with images from which the generative systems may ex-\\ntract the mood or atmosphere (cf. AI-supported moodboards [ 10]).\\nFormatting and rephrasing prompts have been shown to influence\\nthe text outcome. Therefore, prompting may allow users to synthe-\\nsize new forms and styles , or translate between different ones. For\\nexample, a prompt might be designed to turn a novel into a screen\\nplay text or a non-linear format (e.g. text adventure).\\n4.3 Providing Inspiration and Feedback\\nPrompts may help to overcome a creative block by generating con-\\ntent. Related, prompts may be useful to simulate personal feedback\\non a given text (e.g. from the perspective of a famous author). Users\\ncan also prompt the model to provide input based on other works\\nand styles (e.g. “What would Shakespeare write here?”), or more\\ngenerally to optimise drafts with various objectives (e.g. “Make this\\ntext more formal”). Moreover, creating new media, such as writing\\nan article, typically involves iteration. Prompts may help users to\\nquickly iterate andexplore multiple variations of a text, also by using\\ndifferent examples and by giving high-level directions (e.g. keywords,\\nstyles).\\n5 CHALLENGES\\nHere we describe key challenges of interactive use of prompting.\\nThese are based on the literature, material shared by practitioners\\nonline, and our own experiences.\\n5.1 Trial and Error / Lack of Guidance\\nPrompt design or engineering has seen little systematic research\\nfrom an HCI perspective and for users remains mostly a trial and\\nerror process. This is also evident from the best practices shared in\\ninformal resources such as blogs and forums on the internet [ 1,5].\\nBeyond that, recent work in HCI and AI reports on techniques\\nsuch as elaboration [ 4], optimisation of key “trigger” words [ 20]\\nor changing the word order [ 14]. A collection of prompts has also\\nbeen started, with a tool to support researchers in writing prompts\\non datasets [ 18]1. However, few of the practically discovered or\\nresearched strategies have led to dedicated user interfaces and\\ninteractive tools for non-technical users.\\nThe most elaborate user interface design we found is AI Chains ,\\nwhich embodies the strategy of breaking down complex prompts\\ninto subtasks that are easier for the model [ 21]. Extrapolating these\\n1https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource, last accessed 27.01.2022observations raises questions about how future interfaces may\\nsupport even more complex prompts andexploring multiple prompts .\\nOverall, we envision that future interactive tools support users in\\ncreating and applying more effective prompts more efficiently and\\ncreatively.\\n5.2 Representation of Tasks and Effects /\\nPrompt IO\\nIf prompts enable users to define custom AI tools, default graphical\\nrepresentations (e.g. icons) might not suffice to describe them. Thus,\\nit is an open question how prompts are represented in the interface\\nand how users can interact to apply or execute them. Realising\\nthis requires discoverability and explanations as well: For instance,\\nhow might users be enabled to understand or remember what a', metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Realising\\nthis requires discoverability and explanations as well: For instance,\\nhow might users be enabled to understand or remember what a\\nprompt-based tool does without rereading the underlying prompt?\\nRelated, current prompts mainly incentivise verbal thinking de-\\nspite visuals or tacit knowledge and skills being part of many cre-\\native practices. It is not clear how to meaningfully incorporate\\nimages in prompts or how to visualise prompts (e.g. to integrate\\nthem into a GUI).\\nIn addition, prompts are often conceptualised as one-time exe-\\ncutions (e.g. write the prompt, then “run” it). However, creative\\nwork is often an iterative approach that requires the exploration\\nof multiple potential outcomes and effects. Currently, it is an open\\nquestion how interfaces might support such iterative explorations\\nof input and output mappings for prompting.\\nMoreover, current constraints may defeat the upside of using\\nnatural language , for instance, if the prompt has to follow a strict\\nstructural format or specific “hidden rules” to be effective. Without\\nadequate interactions and user interfaces, for creative practitioners,\\nwriting prompts might end up being very similar to writing code.\\n5.3 Computational Costs, Generalisation and\\nEthical Concerns\\nLarge generative systems may introduce a noticeable delay which\\nmight affect users’ (creative) work process. For example, delays may\\nprevent quick iterations. A related concern is gatekeeping access\\nto such tools if they are only feasible to operate, for example, for\\nlarge companies.\\nIt is also not clear how well prompts generalise across different\\nmodels . Optimizing a prompt in the context of one model does not\\nguarantee the same performance when using another generative\\nsystem. Besides usability issues this may create a lock-in effect\\nwhere users are forced to continue to use one specific system.\\nFinally, content created via prompting is expected to replicate\\nbiases known from large language models in general, such as racist\\nand stereotypical language.\\n6 DESIGNING USER INTERFACES THAT\\nSUPPORT PROMPTING\\nBased on the literature and own ideas collected in a design session,\\nwe have identified four design goals for user interfaces that support\\nprompting. A particular design may also address multiple of these\\ngoals. We mainly discuss the use case of creative writing in our', metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Free entry is still supported as well.\\nexamples here but expect these design ideas to be useful starting\\npoints for future work more generally as well.\\n6.1 Supporting Users in Formulating Prompts\\nAn effective user interface should support users in drafting prompts\\nquickly and effortlessly. One way this could be achieved is to let the\\nsystem automatically parse a user’s input and create text prompts\\nas in Fig. 1. Furthermore, detected elements can be made editable\\nas graphical UI elements (e.g. dropdown lists). While potentially\\neasy to use, automatic detection may come with limitations, such\\nas on the number of elements the systems recognises. A bottom-up\\napproach would allow a user to manually define prompt improve-\\nments by selecting pre-defined parameters. This way, users have\\nmore granular control over the text prompt (see Fig. 2).\\n6.2 Supporting Users in Combining Prompts\\nAnother key aspect for interaction is to support users in combining\\nmultiple prompts [ 21]. For example, for creative writing, this could\\nenable users to explore multiple story lines in parallel (see Fig. 3).\\nThe user starts out with an initial prompt to generate a numberof potential story lines and decides which are worth continuing.\\nThe selected text outputs can then serve as the context for the next\\ntext prompt. Given the uncertainty of LLM this can be good way to\\nspark the users imagination and explore different directions before\\ndeciding on a final story line. Another way multiple prompts can\\nbe organised can be seen in Fig. 6, where prompts are structured in\\na separate view similar to the computational notebooks, e.g jupyter\\nnotebook.\\n6.3 Supporting Users in Applying Prompts\\nNext to creating text prompts it is also important to think about\\nhow text prompts are embedded in a (known and existing) user\\ninterface and the interactions that apply or execute these prompts.\\nIn Fig. 4 we present a potential interaction flow where users assign\\na symbol to a reusable text prompt in a toolbar. Once such a defined\\nsymbol is selected the user can mark text to apply the underlying\\nprompt, which brings up a dialog showing the generated output.\\nMore generally, stored prompts in the GUI could also be textual or,\\nif possible, represented by a suitable symbol as illustrated in our\\nexample here.', metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Users can then (re-)apply the text transformations defined by these prompts to text selections, such as the “reformulate\\nfriendly” tool here.\\nAs discussed, computational delay can be one of the challenges\\nof designing effective interactions with text prompts. Thinking\\nabout how such delays can be incorporated in the design may help\\na user in applying prompts more creatively. For creative writing,\\none such opportunity could aim to maintain the writer’s flow. For\\nexample, a user might have a short-term writer’s block in which\\ncase it could be helpful to continue writing down another thought\\nfirst, while letting the LLM finish the current paragraph (Fig. 5).\\nOnce the results are ready the user will be notified and can return\\nto edit this text passage.\\n6.4 Representing Prompts in User Interfaces\\nPrompts also have to be represented in the user interface. One ex-\\nample is shown in Fig. 4 where a prompt is visualised as a symbol\\n(smiley) and annotated to a text paragraph (highlighting, popup).\\nAlternatively, prompts can also be organised along side a text. A\\nsimple split between a “prompt” and a “text” view allows users toswitch between editorial and evaluative tasks (Fig. 6). In this sce-\\nnario, the prompt interface is similar to a hypertext or annotation\\ninterface, allowing users to define the structure and the creative an-\\nnotations of the text. The resulting text view can serve as interface\\nfor light edits, but mainly to evaluate the generated output.\\n7 CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we have argued to investigate prompting as a novel\\napproach for human-AI interaction in creative tasks, motivated by\\npromising opportunities around end-user programming of creative\\ntools, creative expressiveness, and inspiration and feedback. Reflect-\\ning on the broader workshop theme, prompting could democratise\\ncreative activities and domains, for example, by enabling users with\\nno specific training to create personalised tools and more creatively\\nwork with text. Furthermore, users might be able to learn through\\nthe verbally expressive interactions and effects enabled by prompts\", metadata={'source': 'example/method_statement/2209.01390.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
