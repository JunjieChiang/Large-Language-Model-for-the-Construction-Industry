### 1. Introduction
This method statement outlines the general method for the feasibility study on temporary widening along the SSK Drive (Works Area W8A, W8B), including topography survey inspection, survey result recording, and inspection records analysis. The content describes the procedure of the survey works, and the required instrumentation and equipment. Risk and safety precautions are also considered. The methods described are subject to review during construction and may be amended as needed. The Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) is included to ensure all parties are aware of the work procedure.

### 2. Scope of Works
The working procedures are applicable to:
- Topography Survey along SSK Drive for the feasibility study on temporary widening (approx. 870m).
- Survey of the site area occupied by CEDD Contract No. NL/2020/07.

- Leica Total Station TS15A or equivalent.
- Leica Digital Level DNA03 or equivalent.
- Tripod and prism pole.
- Barcode invar staff.
- Target set and prism.
- Survey nail with marker ring.
- Spray Paint.
- Red cloth.
- Wood peg and nail.

### 6. Works Methodology
#### 6.1 Accuracy of Survey Control
- **Horizontal Control Network:**
  - Accuracy: 1:30,000.
  - Origin: MTRCL Master Control Station.
  - Traverse Leg: 300m to 1000m.
- **Vertical Control Network:**
  - Accuracy: +/-1mm VN (route < 1km) and +/-4mm VK (route > 1km).
  - Origin: MTRCL master control stations and benchmarks.
  - Traverse Leg: â‰¤ 500m.

#### 6.2 Topography Survey
The survey will cover approx. 870m of SSK Drive, recording as-built road profiles, ground levels, and existing features to determine the extent of temporary widening. The drawings will be at a 1:500 scale. Survey control stations will be established by traverse, complying with required accuracy standards.

### 7. Safety
- Coordination with CEDD Contract No. NL/2020/07.
- Workers will wear reflective vests and safety helmets.
- A pre-meeting will address work nature, safety aspects, and requirements.
- Safety helmets with chin straps, safety boots, high visibility jackets, goggles, gloves, and body harnesses for height work will be provided.
- Emergency situations must be reported to supervisors and the Safety Department immediately. Risk Assessment is in Appendix D.

### 8. Environmental
- **Noise:** General work during normal hours. Permits required for extended hours.
- **Trees:** Minimal risk to existing trees; any issues will be addressed promptly.

### 9. Quality Control
Construction works must comply with the Quality Plan. "Quality Hold Point" activities must be inspected and accepted by MTR's inspectorate before proceeding.
